absolute px;
width %;
Relative fontSize em rem;
Relative viewPort vw, vh, vmin, vmax;


% --> 50% of parent. Always % of parent.
Block level element have witdth of 100% by default.
margin: 0 auto;  Centers things.


Image Inline Default size of themself.
Img Height X Width Relative
Img-Width 100% of parent. (COVER)


Max-Width: Layout will not grow after that. (Container)
max-width: 620px; Range(0-620px not more than that)
Min-Width: Layout will not shrink after that. (Not recommended on Container)
(We can have width and max-width for the container)


Relative units
em -> Relative to parent element's font size. Direct parent. (If not specified then go up and up)
Specify in Body -> font size then give relative 1em, 2em.
(Cascading effect issue)

rems (Always) -> root em, Always relative to root of the page.
body {font size} relative rem;
body {font size : 62.5%} then relative 1rem = 10px, 2rem = 20px.


Picking which unit to use?
Font-size -> rem preferred
Maring padding -> em preferred (As padding and margin pays attention to font size as parent) (Em is relative to font size of element)
